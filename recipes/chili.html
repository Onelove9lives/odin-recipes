    <h1> Chili Recipe from Spend With Pennies </h1>
    <img src="../images/chili.jpg" alt="A bowl of Chili">
    <h3>This easy chili recipe cooks on the stovetop and is perfect served alongside Homemade Cornbread, buttered toast or Buttermilk Biscuits.</h3>

    <p>When making chili on the stove, I simmer it uncovered which allows the chili to naturally thicken without having to add cornstarch or flour. While thickening chili by simmering is the best option, you may not always have time to let it reduce. If you don’t have time to simmer it to thicken you can sprinkle in a little bit of cornmeal or make a cornstarch or flour slurry and add it in.</p>

    <p><strong>Spice Level</strong> - This chili is just right for our liking but you can increase or reduce the spice level to your liking. For extra heat, leave the seeds in your jalapenos or add a few dashes of hot sauce or a sprinkle of chili flakes.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion diced</li>
